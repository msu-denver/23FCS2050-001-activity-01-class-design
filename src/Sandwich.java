/*
A sandwich is defined by a name, number of calories (integer is fine), and price. Users should be able to create a sandwich given its name, number of calories, and price. If informed number of calories or price is negative, make sure those values are initialized to zero. Define “toString” and a method called “isHealthy” that returns true if the number of calories is less than 250, false otherwise.
