/*
A bank account is defined by a number (integer), the name of the owner, and a balance. Users should have the ability to create an account by specifying its number and owner. Balance is always initialized to zero. The class should provide methods to allow deposit (amount informed as parameter), withdraw (amount informed as parameter; balance cannot become negative). You should also implement the “toString” method.
